# Apprentice Chef_Classification Analysis
Built a predictive model on a binomial response variable (Y-variable). 
Using essential Python packages such as; NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. While focusing on machine learning packages such as SciKitLearn and statsmodels. 
This classification modelling focused on feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development. 
The analysis studied machine learning modelling techniques to understand the outcome of the data using: Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (Classification), Classification Trees and Random Forest (Classification).
